Hi Pippin! 


This project I have for you today is called UI Isekai. The word ‘Isekai’ comes from the Japanese term 異世界("different world" or "otherworld"). For this project I have done my best to imagine what a user interface would look like in a different world built upon different history and different values. As prompted by the intro message, the foundation I imagined this world around came from thinking about what this world could have looked like without or with less colonization. A world where most cultures have been able to mingle, express themselves, and be integrated into each of our daily lives. Most of the programming in this project by nature is more speculative than functional. Again it's more about imagining what could be rather than creating a fluid one dimensional experience. 


Throughout, this project, I’ve tried my best to decolonize my own thinking and design wherever possible. For example, for the home button icon, I was going to use an image of a cottage before I realized that most people on this planet can’t even afford to own one. Maybe it's thinking too much into it, but perhaps an image of a cottage being what is conventionally used ends up pushing the capitalistic narrative that settling with your family into a nice big home is the formula to a happy life. I therefore decided to use an image of a tent, a shelter mostly everyone has used or had access to in their life, as the icon.


The home screen allows the user to use a controllable sprite to access various apps. The user still has the option of clicking the app icons with their mouse, but has the option to use the sprite if they are feeling playful. I also tried to introduce your idea of certain icons running away from the user if focused mode is enabled and the result was almost perfect. 


        The first app the user is prompted to explore is the messages app. Using a library script, the user can select one of the 2 contacts who engage in a text conversation with them. These serve the purpose of familiarising the user with this world. More is revealed about the ‘focused mode’ I introduced earlier. I find it crazy even though technology in this day and age exists as an extension of ourselves, we let tech companies control us with their unnecessarily addictive design. For example, the only way to avoid notifications on devices comes from putting them at mute. This comes at the cost of potentially missing urgent calls, messages, or news. This ‘focused mode’ I added aims to imagine a possible solution to that dilemma.


        I have named the app I created for receiving ‘emails’ , ‘Li’, the Confucian concept often rendered as “ritual,” “proper conduct,” or “propriety.”’. I thought about emails today in every region of the world are based on the post office. It's a historically white organization which feels very corporate by nature. I decided to replace it with a more Chinese inspired design. I have always found formal communication through scrolls to be a beautiful and fascinating way of communication. I also decided to completely change up the way the user consumes their emails. Instead of seeing a cluttered list of random emails, the user is displayed each email one at a time, where they are able to make an easy binary choice of skipping them or setting a reminder to view them later. Again, most of the features here are not functional, but aim to imagine what could be.


        The digital garden app allows users to customize their own garden. It's based on your juggle garden exercise. I replaced the shell currency I previously had  with ‘karma’. I wanted to have activity from other apps, such as accepting quests on tendr, to reward the user with karma so they could slowly unlock more features over time, but didn’t have the time or energy to code that in, so instead enjoy being a rich garden owner. 


        Finally, we may have tendr, which is basically tinder but for helping people near you who need favours instead of hooking up with them. (awww how sweet i know). It aims to further the theme of community and collectivism I’ve tried to put forward throughout this project. 


That’s all from me. It has been such a pleasure learning from you and being able to create 3 projects which all have been so different from one another. Still looking forward to sending you more of my work later!
